Bugs & Feature Requests
=======================

Reporting Bugs
--------------

If you run into a problem with pyfrc that you think is a bug, or perhaps there
is something wrong with the documentation or just too difficult to do, please
feel free to file bug reports on the `github issue tracker <https://github.com/robotpy/pyfrc/issues>`_.
Someone should respond within a day or two, especially during the FIRST
build season.

Contributing new fixes or features
----------------------------------

pyfrc is intended to be a project that all members of the FIRST community can
quickly and easily contribute to. If you find a bug, or have an idea that you
think others can use:

1. `Fork this git repository <https://github.com/robotpy/pyfrc/fork>`_ to your github account
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push -u origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create new Pull Request on github

Github has a lot of documentation about `forking repositories <https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo>`_
and `pull requests <https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests>`_,
so be sure to check out those resources.
