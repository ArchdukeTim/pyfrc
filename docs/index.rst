pyfrc documentation
===================

pyfrc is a python 3 library designed to make developing code for RobotPy (the
Python interpreter for the FIRST Robotics Competition) easier.

This library contains a few primary parts:

* A built-in uploader that will upload your robot code to the robot
* An implementation of wpilib that allows you to run robot code on your
  computer without a cRio
* Integration with the py.test testing tool to allow you to easily write unit
  tests for your robot code.
* A robot simulator tool which allows you to run your code in (vaguely) real
  time and get simple feedback via a tk-based UI
