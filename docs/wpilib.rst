Partial WPILib Reference
========================

.. note:: All objects here are found in the wpilib namespace, even though
          they say `pyfrc.wpilib.whatever`

This is not anywhere near a complete reference to everything available
in WPILib. Instead, check out the docs `available online <http://www.virtualroadside.com/WPILib/index.html>`_.
